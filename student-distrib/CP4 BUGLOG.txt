1. ls can only be called about 6 times before getting "directory open failed"

Solution: Close all the files when we are halting.

2. Grep Not working , not printing when it should be -- can't find the file

Solution:  not clearing the buffer properly

3. Similar issues for Cat -- not printing the file

Solution: clear the buffer at the start of getArgs. Also make sure that file read returns the number of bytes read.
