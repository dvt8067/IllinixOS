1. ls can only be called about 6 times before getting "directory open failed"

Solution: Close all the files when we are halting.

2. Grep Not working , not printing when it should be -- can't find the file

Solution:  not clearing the buffer properly

3. Similar issues for Cat -- not printing the file

Solution: clear the buffer at the start of getArgs. Also make sure that file read returns the number of bytes read.

4. Multiple failed testcases in syserr

Solution: syscalls were not checking for invalid arguments. We added parameter checks in all of our system calls, ex: checking the file descriptor number, checking vidmap address, etc.

5. Keyboard deletes everything at the last line after calling Grep

Solution: not correctly handling character deletion at the end of terminal
