CP3 BUGLOG.txt



1. While attempting to call halt(), the program would return to the wrong address, and we would pagefault.

Solution:   We were using the wrong value of EBP. We were using the parent process's EBP in their respective execute. We were supposed to use the current process's
EBP from their respective execute instead.



2. Our backspace was able to delete anything that was in the terminal

Solution: Made a variable that keeps track of what can be deleted by user. Update that variable every time keyboard handler is used and it also refreshes when enter is pressed.
