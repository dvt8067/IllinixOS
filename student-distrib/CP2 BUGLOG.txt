CP2 BUGLOG

1. Page fault exception arises when attempting to fetch an inode block via an offset from the boot block address. The reason was that we were multiplying by 4096 thinking that incrementing
the address would increment it by decimal 1. This was wrong because the type of pointer was our predefined struct. Thus when we incremented*4096, it was going into a whole different page
hence the page fault.

Solution: Don't multply by 4096 when incrementing the address of the boot block array

2. Similar issue, incrementing the address of a datablock wasn't getting us to the next entry inside the block, it was moving to the next data block. 

Solution This caused our file_read to fail. The fix was to make a new struct specifically for data blocks, we then -> the new array we created and we can index the data inside the blocks.
